# Policies for KV - Version 1

These policies need to be created and applied in Vault to allow proper access to KV version 1 secrets engines.

Example Policy:

```json
path "{SECRET_ENGINE}/*" {
  capabilities = ["list", "read"]
}

path "{SECRET_ENGINE}/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update", "delete"]
}
```

Placeholders:

`{SECRET_ENGINE}`: Replace this with the name of your secrets engine.

Example: my-secrets.

Apply Policy via CLI:

```bash
vault policy write kv-v1 kv-v1.hcl
```

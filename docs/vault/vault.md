### Vault Configurations

To enable the extension to interact with Vault, specific policies need to be created. These policies grant permissions for the extension to list, read, create, update, and delete secrets securely.

### Policies
  - [KV Version 1 Policies.](kv/v1.md)

    Suitable for older secrets engines configured with KV version 1.

  - [KV Version 2 Policies.](kv/v2.md)

    Required for secrets engines configured with KV version 2, which includes metadata and versioning.
